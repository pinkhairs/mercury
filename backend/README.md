# Mercury Employee Directory Backend
This is the backend system for the mercury employee directory. The stack is a simple node.js setup using typescript (we like typescript). 



## Running
By default it will run on port 4324.  You can define the env `PORT` to override with your own preference.
```
npm run start:dev // (This will npm install for you as a prestep)
```


## Interview Requirements
```
The purpose of this project is to determine how you would fix these things. For the requirements, complete them to the best of your understanding. 
```

This system is simple, but it seems to have some bugs. We'd like you to do an initial investigation to see if you can find the bugs and fix them. On top of that there are some minor features we'd like to add. 

For the entire process, please document any changes you made and *why* you made them within the code.
