# Mercury Employee Directory Frontend
This is the frontend system for the mercury employee directory. The stack is a simple react.js setup using typescript (we like typescript). 


## Required environment variables
- REACT_APP_API_HOST: This is the base URL for the backend api (See [Backend](../backend))


## Running
Note, the backend will have to be run separately
```
REACT_APP_API_HOST=http://localhost:4324 npm run start:dev
```


## Interview Requirements
```
The purpose of this project is to determine how you would fix these things. For the requirements, complete them to the best of your understanding. 
```

This system is simple, but it seems to have some bugs. We'd like you to do an initial investigation to see if you can find the bugs and fix them. On top of that there are some minor features we'd like to add. 

For the entire process, please document any changes you made and *why* you made them within the code. 


### Features
- [ ] Add a page for the new departments endpoint that list details about that department including employees

### Optional (Bugs|Enhancements)
- [ ] The departments list doesn't seem to load
- [ ] The UI is a little ugly, see if you can make it pretty (show off your css skills)
